 PKU 开源协议
Public Knowledge Unit Open Source Agreement 协议（公共知识开源协议），简称PKU开源协议，促进开源知识的自由传播，确保开源软件知识贡献者的权益，帮助大型企业实现社会责任履行，由北大校友发起的愿景性倡议，希望通过PKU协议促成开源社群的蓬勃发展，凡是标注为PKU开源协议的开源项目，个人和小微企业可以免费使用，而中大型企业如果使用，需要对开源作者支付一定的费用，确保开源作者有一个基本的技术回报，通过PKU开源协议，完美的解决了开源作者无法得到技术回报，基础软件技术从业人员无法独立生存，大型企业没有履行社会责任渠道的问题，促进中国乃至全球开源生态繁荣发展。
协议核心:

PKU开源协议的软件，对个人和小微企业完全免费
大中型企业如果使用PKU开源协议的软件，需要支付一个标准化的License费用： 对于年收入超过千万人民币，不超过一亿人民币的企业使用PKU开源协议软件，需要支付5888元人民币/年；对于超过一亿收入的企业，需要支付12888元人民币/年；
费用支付给开源作者

PKU开源协议 法律手段

通过技术保护技术开发人员的权益
PKU开源协议下设协会，自动为PKU开源协议申请全球范围内的知识产权认证
PKU开源协议下设协会，会自动检测大中型企业对PKU开源协议软件的使用情况，并促成费用支付


促进开源知识的自由传播，确保开源软件知识贡献者的权益，帮助大型企业实现社会责任履行

PKU Open Source License
Public Knowledge Unit Open Source Agreement (PKU Open Source Agreement)
The Public Knowledge Unit Open Source Agreement (PKU Open Source Agreement), abbreviated as PKU OSA, is a visionary initiative launched by Peking University (PKU) alumni to foster the free dissemination of open-source knowledge while safeguarding the rights and interests of contributors. Designed to bridge gaps in the open-source ecosystem, the PKU OSA aims to create a sustainable model that benefits individuals, small businesses, and large enterprises alike, while promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR).
Key Features of the PKU OSA:


Free Access for Individuals and Small Businesses:
Open-source projects licensed under the PKU OSA are freely accessible to individual developers, startups, and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). This ensures grassroots innovation and community-driven growth without financial barriers.


Fair Compensation for Large Enterprises:
Mid-sized and large corporations using PKU-licensed projects are required to pay a reasonable fee to the original contributors. This model ensures that open-source authors receive tangible technical rewards for their work, addressing the long-standing challenge of under-compensation in the open-source sector.


Balancing Sustainability and Accessibility:
By incentivizing corporate contributions while preserving free access for smaller users, the PKU OSA resolves three critical issues:

The lack of financial returns for open-source authors.
The struggle of foundational software developers to sustain livelihoods independently.
The absence of structured CSR channels for large enterprises in the open-source domain.



Global Vision for Open-Source Ecosystems:
The PKU OSA seeks to catalyze the growth of open-source communities in China and beyond, promoting a collaborative, equitable, and thriving global tech landscape.


Mission Statement:
The PKU OSA is more than a license—it is a call to action. By aligning the interests of contributors, users, and corporations, it strives to build a future where open-source innovation is both accessible and sustainable, ensuring that knowledge remains a public good while rewarding those who create it.
Join the Movement:
Developers, enterprises, and communities are invited to adopt the PKU OSA and contribute to a more inclusive, prosperous open-source ecosystem. Together, we can redefine the future of technology—one line of code at a time.

This concise yet comprehensive overview highlights the PKU OSA’s unique value proposition, its role in addressing systemic challenges, and its aspirational goals for global open-source collaboration.
